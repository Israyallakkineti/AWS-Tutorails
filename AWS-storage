WHAT IS AMAZON VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD (AMAZON VPC): enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. 
HOW DOES WORK: A virtual network environment that allows you create a logically isolated, private network within the aws cloud, providing you with complete control over your network configuration, including IP address range, subnet and security groups.


HOW TO CREATE VPC: instance - VPC - your VPC -create VPC -tag name - VPC-demo1 - CIDR -192.1.0.0/16 (range) -create VPC .
CREATE SUBNET: tag -subnet-demo1 -VPC-demo1 -ap-south-1a -VPC CIDRrs 192.1.0.0/16 -IP 192.1.1.0/24 -create ......> VPC subnet-1 is ready.
CREATE SUBNET 2: tag -subnet-demo2 -VPC-demo1 -ap-south-1b -VPC CIDRrs 192.1.0.0/16 -IP 192.1.2.0/24 -create .......> VPC subnet-2 is also ready( if you have create subnet automaticallu route table also created).check routes and how to talk can each other -subnet associations -edit -click it 2 subnets -save. now subnet firewalls check it.

security -network AcLs -click VPC-demo1 -edit inbound rules -you looking allows status for the all trafic rules like active.
security groups -default security groups is created by subnet and default security groups also created - edit inbound rules -all traffic -subnet eraise and -anywhere -00.00/00 port -save.



   						     NAT Gateways
						_________________________

A NAT gateways in amazon web services (aws) is a Network address transalation (NAT) service that allows private subnets to access services outside the subnet while keeping them inaccessible to unsolicited traffic.

how to create NAT Gateways : go to instance and search NAT Gateway -create NAT Gateway -demo-nat 1 (create) -( private )subnet name(ex;subnet1-demo1 tack it -allocate Elastic IP (click it) -create -ofter deploying NAT -route tables- demo1- private tack it or click it -routes -edit routes -add routes - i will give all the connections 0.00.0/0 and search nat click it something -save routes -if you have internet access for your terminal tack public IP/A copy and ssh paste it in your internet accessed NAT Gateway's.


						     VPC PEERING
						_____________________

Amazon web services(AWS), *peering is a networking feature that allows two virtual private clouds (VPCs) to communicates securely and directly*. how to works ----VPC peering uses private IP addresses to route traffic between VPCs allowing resources in each VPC to interact as if they were part of the same network.

How to create VPC: go to AWS dashboard -search VPC click it- and lunch instances -ubuntu server -default VPC deployed tack it -key name - create. - go to security groups and tack inbound rules and traffics - all -lunch instances.

Create peering connection: name demo1 - VPC-demo1 -VPC Accepeter -default VPC tack it -create peering - click on actions -accept request - accept. active 
add route table -subnet1-demo1 click it -routes -edit -172.31.0.0/16 and peering connection save route successfully and public IP/A kuda add chryochu.as same (VPC-demo1).(ping public IP/A ping avuthundhi and same changes for is go to VPC-demo1 inbound rules all traffic anywhere - 0 serch cheyu add cheyu. save)ping IP/a paste.(connect two peering ).


						WHAT IS AMAZON EMR
		        		   ____________________________

Amazon EMR is a managed cluster platform that simplifies running big data frameworks, such as apache Hadoop and apache spark, on AWS to process and analyze vast amounts of data. by using these frameworks and related open-source project, such as apache hive and apache pig, you can process data for analytics purposes and business intelligence workloads.
EMR Architecture: remains identical to the normal Hadoop cluster architecture and local files system of the nodes, HDFS or EMRFS are uses as storage modes for EMR. 
EMR Applications : Amazon EMR supports may applications , such as hive, pig and the spark streaming library to provide capabilities such as using higher-level languages to create processing workloads, leveraging machine learning algorithms, making stream processing applications and building data warehouses, in adition, amazon EMR also supports open-source project that have their own cluster management functionality instead of using YARN.  


						HANDS-ON HIVE WITH EMR:---
					___________________________________________

Go to dashboard - EMR search - and create a bucket here ---> create bucket -bucket name -region -create -now i create a bucket. and go to EMR -create  cluster -cluster name -default s3 bucket -(choose) cluster -application choose 1 option -hardware conf is default -security access -ec2 keypair lo yobro tack it - now another included for us advance option is only one for that - step type -Hive program -add step -name (Hive program) -script s3 location (s3://us-east-1.elasticmapreduce.samples/cloudfront/code/Hive_CloudFront.q) -inputs3 location (s3;//us-east-1.elasticmapreduce.samples) -output s3 - bucket name -arguments (This sample shows you how to analyze CloudFront logs stored in S3 using Hive) -action and failure is (continue) -add -next -next -next -security option yobro -create cluster. now the cluster is ready s3 bucket application also is ready but 10 -15 minutes time has to ready for this and go to s3 buckets and down option is there downloaded as you wish the file.
