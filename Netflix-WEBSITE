(1) Create VPC :- name tag Netflix -CIDR name 10.1.0.0/16 -create. VPC ID will be create ..
(2) Create Subnet:- name tag public-2a -Netflix VPC -us-west-2a -CIDR 10.1.0.0/16 -CIDR block 10.1.1.0/24 create. create another subnet also
(3) Create Subnet:- name tag public-2b -Netflix VPC -us-west-2b -CIDR 10.1.0.0/16 -CIDR block 10.1.2.0/24 create.
(4) Create Subnet:- name tag private-2a -Netflix VPC -us-west-2a -CIDR 10.1.0.0/16 -CIDR block 10.1.3.0/24 create.
(5) Create Subnet:- name tag private-2b -Netflix VPC -us-west-2b -CIDR 10.1.0.0/16 -CIDR block 10.1.4.0/24 create. i will have access internet connection to my networks to public networks.
(5) internet gateway:- name tag Netflix-network-ig -create -go to actions -attach to VPC -Netflix VPC connected -attached internet gateway. the resources not access. then route table is automatically create that name is internet-route-table. Create another route -table also....internet-route-table click - attach the subnets as -subnet associations -edit subnet associations -attach all public subnets -save. -edit routes -add routes -0.0.0.0/0 -internet gateway -save routes
(6) Create route-table:- name tag non-internet-route-table -Netflix VPC -create. non-internet-route-table click - attach the subnets as -subnet associations -edit subnet associations -attach all private subnets -save. just a small change -public-2a -actions =modify auto-assign -enable click it -save. public-2b also the same. (just tack it easy to search where is my IP address c AWS provides). 
(7) NOW CREATE INSTANCE:- proxy -t2-micro -ubuntu -networks Netflix VPC -click the select an security groups -click default -keypair -lunch instances server. And
(8) go to security groups -now changing the default inbound rules -edit -source -my IP server save. And
(9) then putty host name paste public IP address -ssh -auth -browse -select the ppk file click on open or keypair as well do connect putty -And chmod 500 keypair name -sudo apt-get update (web-server) sudo -apt-get install apache or apache2 -yes - and may be paste the public IP on new website now coming to the apache2 (web-server) is open now i will create the some code.
<html>
<body>
<h1>WELCOME TO THE HOME PAGE!</h1>
</body>
</html> and refresh (apache2 website) now will be coming to the (WELCOME TO THE HOME PAGE!)
(10) go to dashboard proxy server click it -actions -image -create images -image name -Netflix-home -create. now go to image section AMIs -Netflix-home has been created. then has pending status in multiple time refresh it's. now creates. then after 
<html>
<body>
<h1> WELCOME TO THE STREAMING!</h1>
</body>
</html> and to go to dashboard proxy server click it -actions -image -create images -image name -Netflix-streaming -create. as per as lunch instance -my AMIs as ther eclick it -Netflix-home image -select - t2 micro -network -Netflix VPC -subnet private-2a network  -select the select an existing security group -same keypair -lunch. and name was instance name is Netflix-home. now youn looking for the public IP address because i can deploy for the private network. now go to AMIs -click the Netflix-stream -actions -lunch -t2 micro -subnet private-2b network  -select the select an existing security group -same keypair -lunch. and name was instance name is Netflix-streaming. now i have 2 servers and i will not access public IPs.this have not providing internet access. 
i will be connecting to this home and streaming server let'c how can do connected. you can proxy public IP address copy and then next process should be as much of it. /home/ubuntu (enter)7:05 i can't understand....! ssh -i copy pem and private IP home and stream  and as same wish connect and check the status for running status.

(11) load balancer: create load balancer -name Netflix-demo -internet-facing -HTTP protocol -Netflix-VPC -available zone -i have connect to 2a and 2b subnets -next -next -home-page-server -next -Netflix-home click -next -create. I can create one more target group - create -streaming-server -create. home-page server not connect to the -edit registered -Netflix-home click add registry save. and then same as streaming-server -edit -Netflix-stream click it and save. both them targets attached.

load balancer -Netflix-demo click it and how to configure that uses -listener -default view/edit/rules click it .click + -insert rule -add condition -path -/watch* add action forward to request click it -streaming-server -right click assemble -save and one more  click + -insert rule -add condition -/home* -right click update.. now
go to instance Netflix-home click -tack private IP copy-ssh -i pem ubuntu@ paste -cd /var/www/html/ -sudo mkdir home -sudo cp index.html ./home/ (go to website and home page and stream page) Netflix lo elagayeethgey movies chusetapudu streming ani and movies list chusetapudu home ani ela chupistundho dhaaney manam ekkada create cheeyadam jarigindhi....(FileZilla imp and check freenom you get free url for the projects and login and search it) 7:20
  


WHAT IS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AMI AND INSTANCE : In Amazon machine image is a template or blueprint used to create a virtual server, while an "instance" is the actual server created from that AMI; essentially an AMI is the design for a server, and an instance is a live, running version of that design that you can access and use on the AWS cloud.

DIFFERENCE B/T SCALABILITY AND ELASTICITY : Scalability is the ability to handle the increased load on its current hardware and software resources. Elasticity is the ability of a  system to increase the workload by increasing the hardware/software resources dynamically
